Vocal is a currency platform for promoting social change and civic engagement.

We are in beta at https://www.vocalcoin.com

### What Vocal Solves:

What Vocal solves:
- Engagement in politics has reached record lows by younger demographics
- No transparency into others opinions and issues happening around me.
- We have an immutable ledger of votes and issue creation (using the Ethereum blockchain) that serves as proof of when votes/issues were created.
- No real incentive system for political participation, we now propose/create that system through the use of Vocal coin - which can be redeemed for agenda promotion, issue creation (and other things to come) through a traceable currency.
- No widely accessible platform for political engagement and discovery
- Yelp-like platform enables map-search of active political issues. Quickly and easily find the issues that are most pertinent to you and your community, without having to sift through a world of political agendas/issues.


### How it works:

<ol>
    <li>User signs up for a vocal account (this will automatically create a 'Vocal' wallet for that user) </li>
    <li>User earns Vocal coin by casting votes on particular government issues
    </li>
    <li>User redeems those vocal token for promoting his or her own initiatives (and/or social credit? i.e. user gains publicity)</li>
</ol>


### Future Work

- Better sorting/searching/filtering of issues on the map. i.e. finding by categories or creators.
- Implement remaining use cases for Vocal coin
- Potentially make Vocal purchaseable on the Ethereum blockchain. One unit of Vocal today might be redeemable for some amount of political value, but might be worth much more in the future (offers speculative value).
- Interaction/Trading between users
- Improve UI / Remaining Beta Bug Fixes
